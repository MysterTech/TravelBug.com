# TravelBug

- User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
- When logged in, a user can add trips, and edit and delete their trips.
- Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- When a trip is entered, it has a Destination, StartDate, EndDate, and Comment.
- When displayed, each entry also has a day count to trip start (only for future trips).
- User can filter trips.
- Print travel plan for next month.
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication.
- It must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
- Functional UI/UX design is needed.
